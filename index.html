        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>I exist in an intersection between
          Business Consultancy, Brand & Marketing Communications Management & design thinking.
          My interests lie in walking a mile in the shoes of my client's customers.
          My approach to problem solving in business stems from human-centered design. Using my analytical mind, I develop solutions using data-driven insights.
          I work by researching the problems from the customers perspective, drawing up use-cases and delivering solutions to businesses with best-practices to ensure that business is profitable, while maintaining optimum satisfaction to their
          customers.
          My work spans various verticals like Education, Fintech, Inventory & Fashion and in each of these roles, my KPIs have been tied to high growth and expanding the scope of the businesses into the digital space.
